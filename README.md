Some of my favorite software quotes

"In my experience, you either have encapsulation and abstraction or you have neither. There is no middle ground." - Steve McConnell, Code Complete

"The secret to building large apps is never build large apps. Break your applications into small pieces. Then, assemble those testable, bite-sized pieces into your big application" - Justin Meyer, JavaScriptMVC

"Premature optimization is the root of all evil" - Donald Knuth

"Programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute" - Donald Knuth

"C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off" - Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++

"A language like Ruby is a toolbox with some really neat little tools that do their job really nicely. JavaScript is a leather sheath with a really really sharp knife inside. That knife can cut anything, and with it you can do anything. You can kill a bear. You can catch fish. You can whittle a piece of wood into a pony. It’s even a toothpick." - Nick Morgan, skilldrick.co.uk

"Programming with .NET is like cooking in a McDonalds kitchen.  It is full of amazing tools that automate absolutely everything.  Just press the right button and follow the beeping lights, and you can churn out flawless 1.6 oz burgers faster than anybody else on the planet.

However, if you need to make a 1.7 oz burger, you simply can’t.  There’s no button for it.  The patties are pre-formed in the wrong size.  They start out frozen so they can’t be smushed up and reformed, and the thawing machine is so tightly integrated with the cooking machine that there’s no way to intercept it between the two.  A McDonalds kitchen makes exactly what’s on the McDonalds menu — and does so in an absolutely foolproof fashion.  But it can’t go off the menu, and any attempt to bend the machine to your will just breaks it such that it needs to be sent back to the factory for repairs." - Dave Barrett, expensify.com

"Plans were created months in advance as part of the contract negotiation process. Each project was assigned a project manager whose job was to find ways to make reality match the schedule. Clearly a thankless job, since reality objects to being changed. Schedules can be changed to match reality; that's easy. Changing reality, on the other hand, takes special powers." - James Shore, jamesshore.com

"If you graduate Stanford at 22 and Google recruits you, you’ll work a 9-to-5. It’s probably more like an 11-to-3 in terms of hard work. They’ll pay well. It’s relaxing. But what they are actually doing is paying you to accept a much lower intellectual growth rate. When you recognize that intelligence is compounding, the cost of that missing long-term compounding is enormous. They’re not giving you the best opportunity of your life. Then a scary thing can happen: You might realize one day that you’ve lost your competitive edge. You won’t be the best anymore. You won’t be able to fall in love with new stuff. Things are cushy where you are. You get complacent and stall." - Stephen Cohen, CEO of Palantir

"If quality doesn't matter much, though, you’re not gonna get a lot better over time. You'll end up doing the same mediocre things over and over again, working with mediocre people. That's a bad thing. Don't stay in an environment like that." - Max Horstmann, maxhorstmann.net

"Working in a well-organized project is like strolling down a manicured path in an enchanted forest. The opposite is true of a poorly organized code base; it's like running through a jungle. You never know what might pop out at you - Oh look, you just tripped over a rock and a tiger ate you!" - Dan Chak, Enterprise Rails

"I can only think of so many good ideas in a week. Having other people contribute makes my life easier." - Martin Fowler, Refactoring

"It isn't reasonable to ask that we achieve perfection. What is reasonable is to ask that we never cease to aim for it." - Atul Gawande, Complications

"If a problem has no solution, it may not be a problem, but a fact - not to be solved, but to be coped with over time." - Shimon Peres

"The best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas." - Linus Pauling

"If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." - Henry Ford (or so people say)

"There is no technology. There is no design. There is only a vision of how mankind should be, and the relentless resolve to make it so. The rest is details." - Bret Victor

"The best choice of software is often no software." - Jeff Atwood

"Fail fast so you can succeed sooner." - Scott Klemmer, HCI Professer @ Stanford

"Solving a problem simply means representing it so as to make the solution transparent." - Herbert Simon

Not a quote, but an excellent article on why constructor injection is important in Ruby: http://solnic.eu/2013/12/17/the-world-needs-another-post-about-dependency-injection-in-ruby.html
